      <p>By placing an order, you confirm that you have read, understood, and accepted the following
        policy.</p>
      <p><strong>Returns:</strong></p>
      <p>We offer a 7-day quality guarantee for damaged/faulty item(s). Customers can return defective
        item(s) for a refund, replacement, or exchange. Please initiate your request of choice in
        our contact portal&nbsp;<a href="http://asiup.com/contact">here</a>. Requests older than 7
        days from delivery date will not be accepted.</p>
      <p>For non-quality related issues such as no longer wanting the item, ordering the wrong size or
        color, we’re happy to offer size/color exchanges within 7 days of the order delivery date.
        If you’d like to swap an item for another size or color, simply go to&nbsp;<a href="http://asiup.com/contact">contact us</a>&nbsp;to request the exchange.</p>
      <p>Returned item(s) must be unwashed, unworn, unused, and in brand new condition with tags.
        Exchange requests must be for products with the same or lower value only. We do not provide
        pre-paid return labels; you are responsible for covering shipping costs to return except in
        cases where the item is confirmed to be faulty by our team. You will be notified via email
        about your return status. If you are eligible for a refund, the refund amount will be
        credited to your original payment method within 3-7 days. Please note the original shipping
        charge is non-refundable.</p>
